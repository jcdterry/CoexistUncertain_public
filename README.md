Code to support response to “Small rainfall changes drive substantial changes in plant coexistence” (https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-022-05391-9).

Original data from the authors is available at https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.7083314. Both scripts written by Chris Terry (christopher.terry at biology.ox.ac.uk), but wherever possible drawn from the original analysis scripts by Van Dyke et al  

Note that both scripts point towards the location of the original data. 

Because the model fits take a few minutes, these are included pre-fit.
